**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found it especially interesting to learn about the different causal-relationship models that describe how variables depend on each other. Many of these models also form the basis of the data-generation process we use to simulate datasets for our Causal Copilot paper replication, so understanding them helped me connect the theoretical ideas to the practical tools we’re using.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For Quarter 2, I would like to investigate which types of causal data-generation structures Causal Copilot performs best on, and how its performance varies depending on the causal-analysis algorithm selected. This would help determine the kinds of datasets and causal patterns the tool is most reliable for.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
If I could change something about our current project approach, I would incorporate TA check-ins earlier and more frequently. Different mentors move at different paces, and having earlier feedback loops would help groups adjust sooner and avoid being blocked later in the quarter.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in exploring additional causal-relationship modeling techniques and using them to simulate a wider variety of datasets. This would allow for more robust testing of Causal Copilot under different causal structures.
