## Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Different causal-relationship models that define dependencies between variables, some of which we’re using to simulate data to test how to use the Causal Copilot.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Investigate which causal data-generating relationships the Causal Copilot performs best on, as a function of the selected causal analysis algorithm.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Include TA check-ins earlier in the quarter and schedule more of them to support different mentor timelines and unblock teams faster.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Explore and implement additional causal-relationship modeling approaches while simulating data to test the Causal Copilot.
