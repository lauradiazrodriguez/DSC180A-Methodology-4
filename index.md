**Section:** Causal Copilot  
**Mentor:** Biwei Huang

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Different causal-relationship models that define dependencies in data, some of which we’re using to simulate data to test causal copilot usage.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Investigate which causal data relationships causal copilot performs best on, across selected causal-analysis algorithms.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Schedule TA check-ins earlier and more frequently to match mentor timelines and unblock sooner.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Explore and implement additional causal-relationship models while simulating data to test causal copilot.
